    "You keep reading about \"embeddings this\" and \"embeddings that\", but you might still not know exactly what they are. You are not alone! Even if you have a vague idea of what embeddings are, you might use them through a black-box API without really understanding what’s going on under the hood. This is a problem because the current state of open-source embedding models is very strong - they are pretty easy to deploy, small (and hence cheap to host), and outperform many closed-source models.\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding represents information as a vector of numbers (think of it as a list!). For example, we can obtain the embedding of a word, a sentence, a document, an image, an audio file, etc. Given the sentence “Today is a sunny day”, we can obtain its embedding, which would be a vector of a specific size, such as 384 numbers (such vector could look like [0.32, 0.42, 0.15, …, 0.72]). What is interesting is that the **embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the information**. For example, embedding the sentence “Today is a sunny day” will be very similar to that of the sentence “The weather is nice today”. Even if the words are different, the meaning is similar, and the embeddings will reflect that.\n",

The embedding is also learned, but instead of training an embedding model and then another model for the specific task, transformers learn useful embeddings in the context of their task.

Attention allows the model to weigh other words' importance and capture contextual information. For example, in the sentence “I went to the bank to deposit money”, the word “bank” is ambiguous. Is it a river bank or a savings bank? The model can use the word “deposit” to understand that it’s a savings bank.

    "Other models are not trained in a way that they produce normalized embeddings - they are tuned for dot-product. In this case, dot-product will be the best function to find the closest items in a vector space. Even then, if the magnitude is not important, we can normalize as we did in the previous sections. **You can use different distance functions depending on your use case**. Models with normalized embeddings will prefer shorter sentences, while models with non-normalized embeddings will prefer longer sentences. This is because the magnitude of the embeddings will be larger for longer sentences.\n",

    "One approach is to use an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm. These algorithms partition the data into buckets of similar embeddings. This allows us to quickly find the closest embeddings without having to compute the distance to all of them. This is not exact, as some vectors with high similarity might still be missed. There are different libraries you can use to do this, such as Spotify's [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) and Facebook's [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss). Vector databases such as Pinecone and Weaviate also use nearest neighbor techniques to be able to search millions of objects in milliseconds.\n",

The algorithm is focused on getting the **top matches** - using `top_k`, for each sentence in a query chunk, the algorithm just selects the top k matches from the corpus chunk. This means that the algorithm will not find all the matches, but it will find the top matches. This is a good trade-off as we usually don't need all the matches, but just the top ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is to know where to discover sentence embedding models. If you're using open-source ones, the Hugging Face Hub allows you to [filter for them](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers). The community has shared over 4000 models! Although looking at the trending models on Hugging Face is a good indicator (e.g., I can see the Microsoft Multilingual 5 Large model, a decent one), we need more information to pick a model.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Sequence length.** As discussed before, you might need to encode longer sequences depending on the expected user inputs. For example, if you're encoding long documents, you might need to use a model with a larger sequence length. Another alternative is to split the document into multiple sentences and encode each sentence separately.\n",
    "* **Language.** The leaderboard contains mostly English or multilingual models, but you can also find models for other languages such as Chinese, Polish, Danish, Swedish, German, etc.\n",
    "* **Embedding dimension.** As discussed before, the larger the embedding dimension, the more information the embedding can capture. However, larger embeddings are more expensive to compute and store.\n",
    "* **Average metrics across tasks.** The leaderboard contains multiple tasks, such as clustering, re-ranking, and retrieval. You can look at the average performance across all tasks to get a sense of how good the model is.\n",
    "* **Task-specific metrics.** You can also look at the model's performance in specific tasks. For example, if you're interested in clustering, you can look at the model's performance in the clustering task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the purpose of the model is also essential. Some models will be generalist models. Others, such as [Specter 2](https://huggingface.co/allenai/specter2), are focused on specific tasks, such as scientific papers. I won't dive too much into all the tasks in the leaderboard, but you can look at the [MTEB paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316) for more information. Let me give a brief summary of MTEB.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![MTEB tasks image from the paper](mteb.png)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316)\n",

    "MTEB provides a benchmark of 56 datasets across eight tasks and contains 112 languages. It's easily extensible to add your datasets and models to the leaderboard. Overall, it's a straightforward tool to find the suitable speed-accuracy trade-off for your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today's (Jan 7th, 2024) top model is a large model, E5-Mistral-7B-instruct, which is 14.22Gb in size and an average of 66.63 over the 56 datasets. One of the next best open-source models is BGE-Large-en-v1.5, which is just 1.34Gb and performs an average of 64.23. And the base model for BGE, which is even smaller (0.44Gb), has a quality of 63.55! As a comparison, text-embedding-ada-002, even if it provides larger embeddings of 1536 dimensions, performs with a quality of 60.99. That's number 23 in the MTEB benchmark! Cohere provides better embeddings, with a quality of 64.47 and embeddings of 1024 dimensions. \n",

The results are quite interesting! The costs were many orders of magnitude higher, and the quality was considerably lower than smaller models.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's interesting to look at the different tasks covered in MTEB to understand potential sentence embedding applications better.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bitext Mining.** This task involves finding the most similar sentences in two sets of sentences, each in a different language. It is essential for machine translation and cross-lingual search.\n",
    "* **Classification.** In this application, a logistic regression classifier is trained using sentence embeddings for text classification tasks.\n",
    "* **Clustering.** Here, a k-means model is trained on sentence embeddings to group similar sentences together, useful in unsupervised learning tasks.\n",
    "* **Pair Classification.** This task entails predicting whether a pair of sentences are similar, such as determining if they are duplicates or paraphrases, aiding in paraphrase detection.\n",
    "* **Re-ranking.** In this scenario, a list of reference texts is re-ranked based on their similarity to a query sentence, improving search and recommendation systems.\n",
    "* **Retrieval.** This application involves embedding queries and associated documents to find the most similar documents to a given query, crucial in search-related tasks.\n",
    "* **Semantic Similarity.** This task focuses on determining the similarity between a pair of sentences, outputting a continuous similarity score, useful in paraphrase detection and related tasks.\n",
