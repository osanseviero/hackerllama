### Currently: Leading Developer Experience at Google DeepMind

Our mission is to empower developers to build with AI by providing a great developer experience for Google DeepMind’s AI products, including AI Studio, the Gemini API, and Gemma.

As the Developer Experience Lead, I drive developer success and product adoption by ensuring our developer products are intuitive, powerful, and easy to build with. My work involves:

* **Strategic Integration**: Partnering with developers' favorite tools and platforms to ensure seamless integration.
* **Developer Advocacy & Empathy**: Influencing product roadmaps, leading educational initiatives, and crafting world-class documentation based on deep developer empathy.
* **End-to-End Lifecycle**: My team is involved from early technical designs and feature ideation to successful launches and continuous iteration.
* **Model Launches**: Leading the developer experience and launches for major models including **Gemini 3**, **Gemma**, and **Nano Banana**.

Open ML has a big place in my heart, and hence I'm very involved in GDM open model efforts, such as MedGemma, EmbeddingGemma, and more.
